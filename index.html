        <h1>Interactive Design Analysis: Broomstick.com</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my exploration of interactive design principles on Broomstick.com, a captivating platform that showcases the evolution of janitors through immersive storytelling. As I delve into various aspects of the website's design, I'll focus on user engagement, navigation, and the overall narrative experience.</p>

            <div class="heading-box">
                <a href="#question1"><h2>QUESTION 1</h2></a>
            </div>
            <p>The captivating visual storytelling aspect of the experience immediately drew me in, enhanced by the black, grey, green, and blue colour scheme. These colours, in alignment with principles of affordance and feedback, not only appealed to the eye but also conveyed deeper meanings related to the narrative of janitors' evolution. The seamless integration of colours and imagery, reminiscent of a storyboard, effectively set the stage for an engaging exploration of the storyline.</p>

            <div class="heading-box">
                <a href="#question2"><h2>QUESTION 2</h2></a>
            </div>
            <p>Throughout my two-minute interaction, I navigated through the single-scroll format, observing how elements of the website, such as text and imagery, gracefully fell into place as I scrolled. This dynamic animation, a testament to principles of user control and freedom, ensured a smooth and intuitive browsing experience. Additionally, clicking on menu options at the top allowed me to effortlessly explore different sections of the story, enhancing the overall usability of the interface.</p>

            <div class="heading-box">
                <a href="#question3"><h2>QUESTION 3</h2></a>
            </div>
            <p>The continuous scroll of the storyline proved to be the most engaging aspect of the experience for me. This cohesive narrative flow, combined with visually appealing design elements, kept me immersed in the story of the janitors' evolution from start to finish. Perceived affordances were evident here, as the intuitive design encouraged me to explore the narrative at my own pace, without interruption.</p>

            <div class="heading-box">
                <a href="#question3"><h2>QUESTION 4</h2></a>
            </div>
            <p>Scrolling through the storyline emerged as the most common action during my interaction. The single-scroll format, in line simplicity, encouraged seamless exploration of the entire narrative without the need to navigate through multiple pages or sections. This user-friendly design choice facilitated a more immersive and uninterrupted experience.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <div class="heading-box">
                <a href="#question3"><h2>QUESTION 5</h2></a>
            </div>
            <p>My impression of the interactive experience's primary goal was to captivate users with a compelling storyboard-like narrative of janitors' evolution. The absence of videos signalled a deliberate focus on textual and visual storytelling, echoing principles of minimalist design. This emphasis on content over distractions aimed to draw users deeper into the narrative.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <div class="heading-box">
                <a href="#question3"><h2>QUESTION 6</h2></a>
            </div>
            <p>The interactive experience effectively communicated its primary goal through the seamless integration of text and imagery, reminiscent of a storyboard. This alignment with both Norman's and Nielsen's principles ensured a cohesive and engaging user experience. The use of colours and scrolling animation further reinforced the narrative flow, guiding users through the evolution of janitors in a visually compelling manner.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <div class="heading-box">
                <a href="#question3"><h2>QUESTION 7</h2></a>
            </div>
            <p>I perceived that the experience should be interacted with over time to fully appreciate the depth of the story. This aligns with Norman's concept of exploration, as users are encouraged to revisit the website repeatedly to uncover new details and insights. The continuous scrolling format and menu options at the top provided a structured framework for users to navigate the narrative at their own pace, in accordance with user control.

        <section>
            <div class="heading-box">
                <a href="#question3"><h2>QUESTION 8</h2></a>
            </div>
            <p>The interactive experience effectively communicated how it should be interacted with over time by offering a continuous scrolling format that invited users to explore the story at their own pace. The presence of menu options at the top ensured flexibility, allowing users to revisit specific sections as desired. This adherence to both Norman's and Nielsen's principles facilitated a seamless and intuitive user experience.

        <section>
            <div class="heading-box">
                <a href="#question3"><h2>QUESTION 9</h2></a>
            </div>
            <p>The website referenced other media forms such as images and text, rather than videos, to enrich the storytelling experience. This choice emphasises content-focused design, ensuring that users could immerse themselves fully in the narrative without distractions. The cohesive use of colours, imagery, and typography in the black, grey, green, and blue colour scheme added depth and visual interest to the storytelling experience</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <div class="heading-box">
                <a href="#question3"><h2>QUESTION 10</h2></a>
            </div>
            <p>The reference to a storyboard-like experience communicated that users should engage with the narrative by immersing themselves in the storyline from beginning to end. This alignment with user engagement encouraged users to explore the entire narrative without distractions. The single-scroll format further emphasised the linear progression of the story, facilitating a more immersive and focused user experience.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <div class="heading-box">
                <a href="#question3"><h2>QUESTION 11</h2></a>
            </div>
            <p>The storyboard-like experience suggested that users should feel intrigued and captivated by the narrative, much like reading a compelling story or watching a captivating movie. This aids engagement and satisfaction ensuring that users feel drawn into the world of the janitors' evolution. The seamless integration of text and imagery, coupled with the smooth scrolling animation, created a sense of immersion that resonated with users.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <div class="heading-box">
                <a href="#question3"><h2>QUESTION 12</h2></a>
            </div>
            <p>The most lacklustre part of the interaction is encountering technical issues such as slow loading times or glitches in the scrolling animation. These issues, in contrast to the smooth and seamless experience, disrupted the flow of the narrative and detracted from the overall user experience. Maintaining technical performance is crucial to ensuring user satisfaction and engagement.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <div class="heading-box">
                <a href="#question3"><h2>QUESTION 13</h2></a>
            </div>
            <p>Conversely, the most satisfying part of the interaction would likely be when the pieces of the website, such as text and imagery, fell into place seamlessly as I scrolled through the storyline. This visual effect enhanced the storytelling experience and left a lasting impression on the user. The cohesive narrative flow, combined with engaging design elements, ensured that users felt fully immersed in the story of janitors' evolution.</p>
